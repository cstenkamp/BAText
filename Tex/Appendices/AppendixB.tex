	\begin{itemize}
		\small
		\setlength\itemsep{0.1em}
		\item \textbf{A}: Debug information. Shows FPS, the agent's response time and the time in between two sendings to the agent (the latter two only visible in \term{drive\_AI} mode).
		\item \textbf{B}: The current lap time in seconds.
		\item \textbf{C}: The time difference of the current lap in comparison to the fastest lap so far.
		\item \textbf{D}: Indicator of the current lap. Also shows if a lap is \term{invalid}.
		\item \textbf{E}: Feedback bar, graphically visualizing the time difference of only the current course section in comparison to the fastest lap so far.
		\item \textbf{F}: Indicator for the current game mode. Also indicates if QuickPause is active or if a human interferes in the \term{drive\_AI} mode.
		\item \textbf{G}: Current track progress in percent.
		\item \textbf{H}: Field of view of the first minimap-camera.
		\item \textbf{I}: Field of view of the second minimap-camera, if enabled.
		\item \textbf{J}: The car. As the main camera is fixed behind it, it will always be in this precise position.
		\item \textbf{K}: Visual representation of the values for steering (top), brake-pedal (bottom left) and throttle pedal (bottom right).
		\item \textbf{L}: Visual representation of the game's \textit{progress-vector}. Only visible in \term{drive\_AI} and \term{train\_AI}.
		\item \textbf{M}: Visual representation of the game's \textit{CenterDist-vector}. Only visible in \term{drive\_AI} and \term{train\_AI}.
		\item \textbf{N}: Visual representation of the game's \textit{lookahead-vector}. Only visible in \term{drive\_AI} and \term{train\_AI}.
		\item \textbf{O}: Alternative representation of car's distance to the lane center. Only visible in \term{drive\_AI} and \term{train\_AI}. Overlapping with N due to low screen resolution on the machine used for the screenshot.
		\item \textbf{P}: Time needed for the last valid lap in seconds.
		\item \textbf{Q}: Time needed for the fastest valid lap (throughout different sessions) in seconds.
		\item \textbf{R}: Information about slip-behavious of the car's tires.
		\item \textbf{S}: Speed of the car in kilometers per hour.
		\item \textbf{T}: Indicates a "P" if the car is in reverse gear.
