"OpenAI Gym is a toolkit for reinforcement learning research. It includes a growing collection of
benchmark problems that expose a common interface"

" OpenAI Gym aims to combine the best elements
of these previous benchmark collections, in a software package that is maximally convenient and
accessible. It includes a diverse collection of tasks (called environments) with a common interface, and this
collection will grow over time"


[agent, environment, action, observation, reward, POMDP, episodes...]


ob0 = env.reset() # sample environment state, return first observation
a0 = agent.act(ob0) # agent chooses first action
ob1, rew0, done0, info0 = env.step(a0) # environment returns observation,
# reward, and boolean flag indicating if the episode is complete.
a1 = agent.act(ob1)
ob2, rew1, done1, info1 = env.step(a1)
...
a99 = agent.act(o99)
ob100, rew99, done99, info2 = env.step(a99)
# done99 == True => terminal


Design decisions - clear cut between agent and environment (they only provide environment)
   -> also support online learning, where the agent takes at every action (observation, reward, done)

Suggest additionally to final performance to count how long it took an agent to learn threshold level of average performance
